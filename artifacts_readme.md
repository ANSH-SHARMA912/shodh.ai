# Artifacts Folder

This directory stores all saved machine learning artifacts generated by the pipeline.

## Contents
- **preprocessor.joblib** — ColumnTransformer used for preprocessing.
- **mlp_supervised.pth** — PyTorch model weights for supervised MLP.
- **supervised_probs.npy** — Predicted probabilities for supervised model.
- **cql_policy/** — Saved policy directory generated by d3rlpy (if RL training is executed).
- **disagreements.csv** — Rows where supervised and RL policies diverge.

## Notes
These files are automatically generated after running the full pipeline:
- `01_EDA_and_preprocessing.ipynb`
- `02_supervised_training.ipynb`
- `03_offline_RL_and_evaluation.ipynb`
